<p>
    Galactic Senior Defense Squad is a multiplayer action platformer that takes place in the distant future aboard the interplanetary-senior's-home/spaceship, <i>The Incontinence</i>.

<p>
    The game runs cross-platform across Windows, Mac, and Linux, and pits one parasite against up to three hunters.
    Each player type features dynamic movement options, resulting in a high-tension race around the enclosed quarters of the ship.

    The game includes an in-depth tutorial for each type of player and a dynamic lobby system.
    I wrote robust networking code to handle the asynchronous nature of multiplayer games and employed techniques to ensure a smooth and playable experience regardless of connection lag.
    For example, the game interpolates and extrapolates the positions and velocities of remote entities between update packets.
    This ensures that non-player characters and other players' characters never make jagged leaps in position or speed, and keep the game feeling immersive.

    I loved the iterative process that this larger project afforded, with repeated playtesting and brainstorming sessions.

    After 393 hours of work fit in around a full time software developer job and school, GSDS turned out to be a polished game that I can say I'm proud of.
