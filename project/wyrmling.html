    <em>Wyrmling: First Hunt</em> is a reaction- and strategy-based infinite sidescroller created in two days for <a href='https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2017'>#LOWREZJAM</a>.
    In Wyrmling, you play as a baby dragon sneaking his way through the forest trying to avoid the pesky wolves and traps that make eating birds and their eggs so hard to do.

    I've always found that learning programming languages, tools, and frameworks is entirely on a student's shoulders.
    If you want to have broad experience with a number of these, you have to learn of your own accord at every opportunity.
    I took <em>this</em> opportunity to go from having no experience with the <a href='http://phaser.io/'>Phaser</a> JavaScript game framework, to 48 hours later having completed a game with it.

    This project was a fun way to keep my game development skills sharp, learn a new framework, and do some pixel art!
