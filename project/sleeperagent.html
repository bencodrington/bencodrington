    <em>Sleeper Agent: Ghost Protocol</em> is a memory-testing arcade-puzzle game created in less than 48 hours for <a href='https://itch.io/jam/discord-jam1'>#DISCORDJAM</a>. The theme was 'limited view'.
    In Sleeper Agent, you play as a ghost trying to spook sleeping kids with the help of your trusty night-vision goggles.
    The only catch is that your goggles have a very limited battery life.

    This was the second game jam that I'd used the Phaser framework for. As a result, I was more comfortable with the toolset and able to allocate some time to adding some pixel art animations.

    This particular game jam I tried a little experiment: I didn't make working on it the highest priority in my life.
    I visited a friend during the 48 hours, I slept well, and I joined in at a family event.
    Well, I think the experiment was an overwhelming success!
    I found that these breaks allowed me to recharge and rest, as well as step back and think about the project at a high level, rather than getting caught up in implementation details.
    Each time I returned to the keyboard, I had a clear head and a clear plan of what the next steps were and, crucially, what could be trimmed and re-prioritized.

    One notable exception was that I implemented an 'Endless' mode with a relatively basic procedural generation system.
    The feedback I got later was that the tutorial levels (which I had hand-crafted) were much more fun and interesting than the procedural ones.
    This is the widely acknowledged trade-off for effectively infinite levels, but the fact of the matter was that I was so wrapped up in seeing if I could build this system, that I didn't stop to think if I <em>should</em>.
