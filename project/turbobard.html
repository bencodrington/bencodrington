<p>TurboBard is a web app built to boost player immersion in tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons.</p>
<p>Users can search a database of hundreds of sounds, create groups, and fade seamlessly between them.</p>
<p>And it all happens quickly and smoothly enough that you can improvise with ease when the party goes somewhere unexpected.</p>

</div>
<p>
  The site runs smoothly on desktop and mobile, with a responsive front end design that promotes speed and customization, lovingly constructed with React.

  I continue to maintain and update TurboBard for my own D&D sessions, and for the users around the world who regularly put it to good use.
