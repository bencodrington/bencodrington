    Phanary is an in-browser utility that excels at playing sound effects and ambient music quickly and smoothly.
    Optimized for use in fantasy role-playing games like Pathfinder and Dungeons & Dragons, the site allows the user to create custom sonic atmospheres within seconds.
    Users can adjust relative track volumes, and seamlessly transition between soundscapes at the click of a button.

    The site runs smoothly on desktop and mobile, with a responsive and elegant front end design that promotes speed and customization, lovingly constructed with gulp, webpack and PostCSS.

    This project gave me experience with Node.js, MongoDB, and building a progressive web-app from start to finish, while also refining my front-end skills.
    Working on Phanary really helped me solidify my workflow and git integration.
    After <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6r065o/oc_i_built_a_free_webapp_so_you_dont_have_to/'>posting about the app on reddit</a>,
    the D&D community responded with enthusiasm and suggestions that I utilized to add user-requested features like permanence across sessions.
    To achieve this I researched and implemented the use of browser local storage.

    I continue to maintain and update Phanary for my own D&D sessions, and for the users around the world who regularly put it to good use.
