    <em>ScribbleHead</em> is a stylized puzzle platformer where you play as an illustrated character who uses tools of his medium to avoid or sneak past obstacles and enemies.

<p>
    In ScribbleHead the player must move from the left side of the map to the right side in order to proceed. Each level is made up of a series of discrete yet interconnected puzzles and challenges that incorporate two main mechanics for the player to use.

    My two teammates and I wrote this game for our second-year game design course, and presented it at the Queen's Creative Computing Show in April, with an overwhelmingly positive reception.

    This project challenged me to learn best practices for important components of game development, such as enemy AI, shaders, and team collaboration.
